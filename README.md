    (jobs[job_country]=country)*
    (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(type,jobs[job_schedule_type])))*
    (jobs[salary_year_avg]<>0),
    jobs[salary_year_avg]
)
)
```

* Returns median salary based on multiple filters: job title, country, and schedule type.

### ⏰ Count of Job Schedule Type

```excel
=FILTER(J2#,(NOT(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("and",J2#))+ISNUMBER(SEARCH(",",J2#))))*(J2#<>0))
```

* Filters list to get unique job schedule types by removing invalid entries.

### ❎ Data Validation
